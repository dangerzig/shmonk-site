        <p>My clients are accomplished individuals navigating demanding careers while seeking a more grounded, meaningful life. I help them cut through the noise and distraction to focus on what truly matters.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they're in the midst of a transition—launching a new venture, stepping into a new role. Sometimes they simply sense they could be doing more with their gifts.</p>

            <h2>A different kind of coach</h2>
            <p>As a longtime tech executive at some of the world's most successful companies—and a parent raising two daughters—I've lived these tensions firsthand. I've led teams at Apple, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Google, building products used by billions and scaling organizations through hypergrowth.</p>
            <p>As a recognized Zen meditation teacher, I bring a perspective that reaches well beyond conventional leadership advice. And as an ordained Buddhist priest, our conversations are legally privileged and fully confidential—creating a rare space for honesty that high-profile individuals often struggle to find elsewhere.</p>
            <p>This combination of experience and training allows me to offer far greater depth than a typical executive coach.</p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>I typically recommend meeting twice a month, with email or text support in between. Some clients prefer weekly meetings; others want a monthly check-in. I can support either.</p>
        <p>The initial commitment is six months. Real change tends to emerge over time, not in isolated conversations, and six months allows patterns to surface and shift in a meaningful way. Most executives continue beyond that.</p>
