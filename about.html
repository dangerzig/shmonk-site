            <p class="lead">I'm a coach, teacher, and writer working with people at moments of transition.</p>
            <p>My work integrates deep contemplative practice with decades of experience in leadership and technology.</p>
            <p>I help people find clarity and move forward with integrity.</p>

        <h2>Formation and practice</h2>
        <p>I spent 25 years building technology at companies including Apple, Meta, Google, and YouTube. I led teams through rapid growth, launched products used by billions, and learned what makes leaders effective – and what burns them out.</p>

        <p>Throughout these years, a serious contemplative practice has run alongside. I'm an ordained Zen priest and received Dharma transmission in the Soto Zen lineage. I teach monthly at San Francisco Dharma Collective and lead annual retreats at Tassajara Zen Mountain Center.</p>

          <p style="margin: 0; flex: 1; min-width: 200px; font-size: 1.05rem; max-width: 400px;">In 2025, I received formal recognition from Soto Zen authorities in Japan, a distinction held by few American teachers.</p>

    <!-- What this brings to coaching -->
    <section>
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h2>What this brings to coaching</h2>
        <p>The skills developed through decades of contemplative practice – deep listening, comfort with silence, attention to what's not being said – inform every conversation I have.</p>

        <p>I don't impose a spiritual framework on anyone. But I bring a different lens for looking at leadership: one that values presence over performance, sustainability over sprinting, and wisdom over mere cleverness.</p>

        <p>My books <em>Buddha's Diet</em> and <em>Buddha's Office</em> explore how ancient wisdom applies to modern challenges. The same principles shape how I approach coaching.</p>

        <p>Many of the people I work with are leading teams and organizations in a moment of profound technological change. Having spent decades building and leading technical teams myself, I'm familiar with the pressures of scaling, uncertainty, and rapid change – including the questions raised by AI and automation.</p>

        <p>The work itself isn't about chasing trends, but about staying grounded and thoughtful as those forces unfold.</p>

    <!-- How I work -->
    <section class="section-alt">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p>I typically meet with clients twice a month, with communication in between as needed. Some prefer weekly sessions; others want monthly. I can support either.</p>

        <p>The initial commitment is six months. Real change tends to emerge over time, not in isolated conversations. Most clients continue beyond that.</p>

        <p>As an ordained priest, conversations with me are privileged and confidential – a rare space for honesty that high-profile individuals often struggle to find elsewhere.</p>
