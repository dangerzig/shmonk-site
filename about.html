            <h1>About</h1>
            <p class="lead">I've spent my career at the intersection of technology and human experience—building products that reach billions, leading teams through rapid growth, and thinking deeply about what it means to work well.</p>

            <p>Most recently, I was VP of Data and AI at Headspace, where I led AI strategy and developed LLM-based mental health tools. Before that, I spent four years at Apple as an Engineering Director, launching Apple Journal and contributing to products including iOS Focus Modes, Fitness+, and Vision Pro.</p>

            <p>At Meta, I led data science organizations at both Facebook and Instagram—scaling the News Feed analytics team from 7 to 70 people, then leading a 150-person organization covering all of Instagram's core product areas. At YouTube, I built the data science team from scratch and helped grow ad revenue from near zero to $1 billion.</p>

            <p>Along the way, I've learned a great deal about what makes leaders effective—and what burns them out. I've managed through hypergrowth and uncertainty, navigated complex organizational politics, and mentored hundreds of emerging leaders.</p>

            <h2>A contemplative practice</h2>
            <p>Alongside my tech career, I've maintained a serious contemplative practice. I'm an ordained Zen priest and serve as a Guiding Teacher at Jikoji Zen Center, a Zen Buddhist temple in the hills above Silicon Valley. I'm also a faculty member at the Esalen Institute and a trustee of Naropa University.</p>

            <p>This isn't separate from my professional work—it's deeply connected. My books <em>Buddha's Diet</em> and <em>Buddha's Office</em> explore how ancient wisdom applies to modern challenges. The same principles that inform my meditation teaching—attention, clarity, equanimity—shape how I approach coaching.</p>

            <p>I don't impose this perspective on anyone. But it gives me a different lens for looking at leadership: one that values presence over performance, sustainability over sprinting, and wisdom over mere cleverness.</p>

        <h2>Education & recognition</h2>
        <p>I studied at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating cum laude with a self-designed major in Computational Neuroscience. My senior thesis was on neural network modeling—back when AI was a niche academic interest.</p>

        <p>I've been named one of Wired's "20 Business Geniuses You Need to Know" and have published in the Harvard Business Review, TechCrunch, and peer-reviewed academic journals. I've also written three RFCs (internet standards) and presented research at international conferences.</p>
