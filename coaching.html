        <h2>Who I work with</h2>
        <p>My clients are accomplished individuals navigating demanding careers while seeking a more grounded, meaningful life. I help them cut through the noise and distraction to focus on what truly matters.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they're in the midst of a transition – launching a new venture, stepping into a new role – and sometimes they simply sense they could be doing more with their gifts.</p>
        <ul class="services-list">
          <li>Senior executives and VPs navigating leadership transitions</li>
          <li>Founders and entrepreneurs scaling through rapid growth</li>
          <li>Technical leaders stepping into broader organizational roles</li>
          <li>Accomplished individuals – whether high-profile or undiscovered – seeking a rare space for honest reflection</li>

            <h2>What I bring</h2>
            <p>As a longtime tech executive at some of the world's most successful companies – and a parent raising two daughters – I've lived these tensions firsthand. I've led teams at Apple, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Google. I know what it takes to perform at the highest levels, and I know what it costs.</p>

            <p>As a recognized Zen meditation teacher, I bring a perspective that reaches well beyond conventional leadership advice. I help my clients access the wisdom, clarity, and insight needed to unlock their true potential as leaders, and as human beings.</p>

            <p>And as an ordained Buddhist priest, our conversations are legally privileged and fully confidential – creating a rare space for honesty and candor that high-profile individuals often struggle to find elsewhere.</p>

            <p>This combination of experience and training allows me to offer far greater depth than a typical executive coach.</p>

        <h2>What we work on</h2>

        <h3>Presence and clarity</h3>
        <p>How do you stay grounded when everything around you moves fast? I help leaders develop the capacity to be fully present – in high-stakes meetings, difficult conversations, and the daily demands of executive life.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and meaning</h3>
        <p>Success without meaning is exhausting. I help clients reconnect with what truly matters to them and align their work with their deeper values.</p>

        <h3>Transitions and growth</h3>
        <p>New roles, new companies, new chapters. I help leaders navigate change with confidence, letting go of what no longer serves them and stepping into what's next.</p>

        <h3>Sustainable leadership</h3>
        <p>You can't lead well if you're burned out. I help leaders find ways to perform at the highest levels without sacrificing their health, relationships, or sense of self.</p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <div class="process-steps">
          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-number">1</span>
            <h3>We talk</h3>
            <p>A brief conversation to explore fit – no commitment, no pressure.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-number">2</span>
            <h3>We begin</h3>
            <p>Six-month engagement, typically meeting twice a month via video or in person.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="process-step">
            <span class="step-number">3</span>
            <h3>We continue</h3>
            <p>Most clients stay beyond the initial engagement as patterns shift and deepen.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md);">Sessions include email or text support in between. Some clients prefer weekly meetings; others want monthly. I can support either.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section-alt">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h2>Investment</h2>
        <p>The monthly rate is $4,000 for two meetings per month, and scales up or down according to meeting frequency.</p>
        <p>This investment reflects the depth and confidentiality of the work, and the unique combination of executive experience and contemplative training I bring to our conversations.</p>

            <p>I regularly speak at conferences and organizations on topics including leadership, mindfulness, and the future of work. My clients benefit from this broader perspective – insights drawn from working with leaders across industries and contexts.</p>
            <p>I've spoken at Wisdom 2.0, Inner MBA, and corporate events at companies including LinkedIn and Google. I'm also a faculty member at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur.</p>
