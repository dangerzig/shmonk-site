        <h2>Who I work with</h2>
        <p>My clients are accomplished individuals navigating demanding careers while seeking a more grounded, meaningful life. I help them cut through the noise and distraction to focus on what truly matters.</p>
        <p>Sometimes they're in the midst of a transition—launching a new venture, stepping into a new role—and sometimes they simply sense they could be doing more with their gifts.</p>

          <li>Senior executives and VPs navigating leadership transitions</li>

            <h2>What I bring</h2>
            <p>As a longtime tech executive at some of the world's most successful companies—and a parent raising two daughters—I've lived these tensions firsthand. I've led teams at Apple, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Google. I know what it takes to perform at the highest levels, and I know what it costs.</p>

            <p>As a recognized Zen meditation teacher, I bring a perspective that reaches well beyond conventional leadership advice. I help my clients access the wisdom, clarity, and insight needed to unlock their true potential as leaders, and as human beings.</p>

            <p>And as an ordained Buddhist priest, our conversations are legally privileged and fully confidential—creating a rare space for honesty and candor that high-profile individuals often struggle to find elsewhere.</p>

            <p>This combination of experience and training allows me to offer far greater depth than a typical executive coach.</p>

        <h2>What we work on</h2>

        <h3>Presence and clarity</h3>
        <p>How do you stay grounded when everything around you moves fast? I help leaders develop the capacity to be fully present—in high-stakes meetings, difficult conversations, and the daily demands of executive life.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and meaning</h3>
        <p>Success without meaning is exhausting. I help clients reconnect with what truly matters to them and align their work with their deeper values.</p>

        <h3>Transitions and growth</h3>
        <p>New roles, new companies, new chapters. I help leaders navigate change with confidence, letting go of what no longer serves them and stepping into what's next.</p>

        <h3>Sustainable leadership</h3>
        <p>You can't lead well if you're burned out. I help leaders find ways to perform at the highest levels without sacrificing their health, relationships, or sense of self.</p>

      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>I typically recommend meeting twice a month, with email or text support in between if needed. Some clients prefer weekly meetings; others want a monthly check-in. I can support either.</p>

        <p>Sessions are held via video or in person if you're in the Bay Area.</p>

        <p><strong>The initial commitment is six months.</strong> Real change tends to emerge over time, not in isolated conversations. Six months allows patterns to surface and shift in a meaningful way. Most executives continue beyond that.</p>

    <section class="section-alt">
      <div class="container-narrow">
        <h2>Investment</h2>
        <p>The monthly rate is $4,000 for two meetings per month, and scales up or down according to meeting frequency.</p>
        <p>This investment reflects the depth and confidentiality of the work, and the unique combination of executive experience and contemplative training I bring to our conversations.</p>

      <div class="container-narrow" style="text-align: center;">
        <h2>Let's talk</h2>
        <p>The first step is a conversation. No commitment, no pressure—just a chance to see if we'd work well together.</p>
