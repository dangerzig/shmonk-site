            <h2>Zen teaching</h2>
            <p>I'm an ordained Zen priest and serve as one of the Guiding Teachers at <a href="https://www.jikoji.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jikoji Zen Center</a>, a Zen Buddhist temple in the hills above Silicon Valley. I received Dharma transmission in the Soto Zen lineage and have been practicing and teaching for many years.</p>
            <p>I also teach as a faculty member at the <a href="https://www.esalen.org/faculty/dan-zigmond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esalen Institute</a> in Big Sur and serve as a trustee of <a href="https://www.naropa.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naropa University</a>.</p>
            <p>My teaching emphasizes the integration of practice with everyday life—how meditation and awareness can inform not just quiet moments on a cushion, but also work, relationships, and the full range of human experience.</p>

        <h2>Retreats</h2>
        <p>I lead meditation retreats throughout the year at various venues. Retreats range from single-day workshops to multi-day intensives. They're open to practitioners at all levels—you don't need any prior meditation experience.</p>
        <p>Upcoming retreats are typically listed at:</p>
        <ul class="services-list">
          <li><a href="https://www.jikoji.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jikoji Zen Center</a> — Los Gatos, California</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.esalen.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esalen Institute</a> — Big Sur, California</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you'd like to be notified about upcoming retreats, feel free to <a href="contact.html">reach out</a> and I'll add you to my list.</p>

        <h2>The connection to coaching</h2>
        <p>Some people wonder how Zen teaching connects to executive coaching. For me, they're not separate at all.</p>
        <p>The core of Zen practice is learning to be present—to see clearly, to respond rather than react, to act with intention rather than habit. These are precisely the capacities that make leaders effective.</p>
        <p>I don't bring religious content into my coaching unless a client wants to explore it. But the skills I've developed through decades of contemplative practice—deep listening, comfort with silence, attention to what's not being said—inform every conversation.</p>
